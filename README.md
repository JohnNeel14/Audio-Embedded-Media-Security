In the upload section, select any image you want to convert into audio (in .wav format).

Once converted, the audio file will be saved in the same directory as the uploaded image.

To revert the audio back to the original image, make sure to navigate to the same folder where the converted .wav file is stored.

⚠️ Note: Ensure you're in the correct folder when locating the audio file for image restoration.
